    "In the last assignment, you will apply deep learning methods to solve a particular story understanding problem. Automatic understanding of stories is an important task in natural language understanding [[1]](http://anthology.aclweb.org/D/D13/D13-1020.pdf). Specifically, you will develop a model that given a sequence of sentences learns to sort these sentence in order to yield a coherent story [[2]](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/short-commonsense-stories.pdf). This sounds (and to an extent is) trivial for humans, however it is a quite difficult task for machines as it involves commonsense knowledge and temporal understanding."

    "You will use [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to build a deep learning model for the task. We provide a very crude system which solves the task with a low accuracy, and a set of additional functions you will have to use to save and load the model you create so that we can run it.\n",

    "* The maximum size of a zip file you can upload to moodle is 160MB. We will **NOT** allow submissions larger than that.\n",
    "* We do not have time to train your models from scratch! You **NEED** to provide the full code you used for the training of your model, but by all means you **CANNOT** call the training method in the notebook you will send to us.\n",
    "* We will run these notebooks automatically. If your notebook runs the training procedure, in addition to loading the model, and we need to edit your code to stop the training, you will be penalised with **-20 points**.\n",

However, be aware that you will need to run these models many times over, for a larger number of epochs (more elaborate models, trained on much larger datasets can train for weeks! However, this shouldn't be the case here.). If you find training times too long for your development cycle you can reduce the training set size. Once you have found a good solution you can increase the size again. Caveat: model parameters tuned on a smaller dataset may not be optimal for a larger training set.\n",

    "- experiment with pre-trained word representations such as [word2vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/), or [GloVe](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). Be aware that these representations might take a lot of parameters in your model. Be sure you use only the words you expect in the training/dev set and account for OOV words. When saving the model parameters, pre-rained word embeddings can simply be used in the word embedding matrix of your model. As said, make sure that this word embedding matrix does not contain all of word2vec or GloVe. Your submission is limited, and we will not allow uploading nor using the whole representations set (up to 3GB!)\n",

    "- bucketing and batching (our implementation is deliberately not a good one!)\n",
    "  - make sure to draw random batches from the data! (we do not provide this in our code!)\n",

    "  - sequence-to-sequence encoder-decode architecture for producing the right ordering\n",

    "  - different training algorithms\n",

    "### Approach summary\n",
    "The presented model (section 1.3.2) is a dynamic recurrent neural network, constructed in TensorFlow, which takes vectorised, concatenated sentances and passes each story through a LSTM cell with a drop-out wrapper, applies a linear layer to the output, to produce logits which are softmaxed and argmaxed to predict a class for each sentence. The model trains in under 15 minutes and reaches a test accuracy of 55.5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also built a state-of-the-art 'sequence to sequence' model combined with a Multi-layered Perceptron (section 1.3.1) following Logeswaran et al. (2017) but this failed to beat the test accuracy of the LSTM model (reaching only 11%) for this dataset. We have included this model as demonstration of our efforts. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Pre-processing\n",
    "#### 2.3.1 Pipeline enhancement\n",
    "We  adjusted the provided pipeline function to improve the pre-processing and provide additional information required for our more complex model. Such as, improving tokenisation, adding sentence length and other helper functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.1 Word embedding\n",
    "We built and tested word embedding’s with Google's 'word2vec' and Stanford's 'Glove' techniques (TensorFlow (2017) and Pennington et al. (2014) respectively). We trained the models and tested each model at 100, 200 and 300 dimensions and we implemented the Wiki 2014 pre-trained word vectors from GloVe (http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/#discuss). \n",

    "### 2.4. Models\n",
    "We built two different models as shown in section 1.3.1. 'Sequence-to-sequence + Multi-layered Perceptron' and 1.3.2 'LSTM model'. The structure of each model is described below. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1 Sequence-to-sequence + Multi-layered Perceptron\n",
    "The most promising in theory and by far the most complex model we have built is the **Seq2SeqOrdering** class. This model is based upon the idea of coherence modelling through sequence to sequence prediction. Hence, if a machine can predict the most probable subsequent sentence given the current sentence maximizing the log likelihood of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L(s_{i}, s_{i+1}) = \\frac{1}{N_{i}}\\log p (s_{i+1} | s_{i})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "would allow to discriminate between coherent and arbitrary sentence structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "This model is trained in two stages: \n",
    "\n",
    "> • training a seq2seq model using tensorflow's embedding_rnn_seq2seq wrapper by feeding it the sentences in the right order. \n",
    "\n",
    "> • training a 2-layer perceptron that scores every permutation (120) of the story.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-layer perceptron is trained on the embedding producing by the seq2seq model when an unordered sentence pair is passed into the encoder/decoder. Although the model is efficient to train, producing good sentence predictions after only a few epoch, the inefficiency of the model comes from the fact that it tests each story for each permutation. Despite its good predictive performance, with a mean prediction time of ~10s this model becomes, at least for this assignment, computational intractable. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.2 LSTM model \n",
    "Our baseline model consists of a dynamic RNN with a single LSTM cell. Every sentence is fed into the RNN individually creating a sentence embedding. The five-sentence embedding’s of a story are concatenated and passed into a single linear neural network layer that scores the embedding’s using a softmax. \n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent overfitting and dead neurons the LSTM cell is wrapped into a dropout container that randomly turns neurons on and off. By doing this we could take advantage of an increased number of hidden layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "While increasing the number of hidden layers only marginally improved the final result the model convergered very quickly to its maximum accuracy rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "An adaptive learning rate was incorporated into the model training to reduce the learning rate as test accuracy reached above 53%. This substantially slowed the optimisation rate down at latter stages of training to reduce voliatity and find a better optimum. \n",
    "\n",
    "The LSTM model is far more computationally advance than the stub model that doesn’t use a NN. NNs are able to learn very complex patterns by having very high degrees of freedom compared to linear or simpler models. The LSTM cell benefits further by being able to store and pass memory sequentially which gives it good prediction power for sequential tasks like this. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Parameter optimisation\n",
    "Parameters optimisation was a substantial activity as both models contained a large number of parameters to be tuned. We performed mesh-grid searches on key parameters such as learning rate, batch size and hidden layer size and we're about to add around 15% accuracy by finding local minimas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key parameters for the optimisation were: learning rate, batch size, hidden layer size and embedding size.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process had not been done for the stub model and with quick optimisation of the learning rate we were able to improve the stubs performance to 40%. The stub doesn’t have many other parameters which reduce to amount of optimiation required. \n",

    "#### 2.6.1 Confusion matrix\n",
    "It is shown from the confusion matrix that the first sentence is the most accurately predicted (85%), followed by the second and the last sentences (50-53%). Sentence 3 and 4 are the least accurately predicted (30% each).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first sentences high accuracy is likely to be caused by it having a the most distinct sentence semantics. The first sentence sets the context for the rest of the story and thus may be more distinguishable. For example, the first sentence is restricted in identifying a person by name whereas other sentences can use 'he','she','him', ect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 3 and 4 are in the middle of the story and as such are likely to be the most interchangeable as the wide-ranging story topics are determined here. This will result in a weaker pattern for the NN to identify and lower accuracy.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.6.2 Precision, Recall and F1\n",
    "The model precision and recall agree with the above trend with showing a high recall accuracy (88%) for sentence 1 and lowest accuracy for sentences 2 and 3 (30%).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.7. Further improvements\n",
    "- Improved sequence-to-sequence modelling\n",
    "- Mulit-layered LSTMs - Additional layers of LSMT cells enable more patterns to be learnt form the data. We stacked LSTM cells using the TensorFlow (using rnn_cell.MultiRNNCell) however it worsened performance. Further work could look at optimising the implementation.\n",
    "- Use third party CPUs to perform grid search on all parameters\n",
